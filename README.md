# Cifar100-Image-Classification

- Classified the images in 2 categories and the 5 item labels in each category in Cifar100.
- Implemented by Machine Learning algorithms including KNN, bagging, SVM, and deep learning in python.
- Using the GridSearch to find the best parameter (can get higher prediction score) of each algorithm.

This project had three milestones:
- Milestone 1: selected the test image randomly. (train:test = 5:1)
- Milestone 2: picked one pair in two categories as test data.
- Milestone 3: picked two pairs in two categories as test data.
- Bonus      : picked three pairs in two categories as test data.
